#### Questions and Observations

1. **Is Originality Dead?** As a society, we are constantly searching for originality. However, I’ve come to learn that originality (as we define it) no longer exists. It is impossible to generate a completely novel idea, without repurposing existing ones. Livingstone argues we’ve lost touch with originality. I don’t think so. Aren’t we just redefining originality? “We can ‘put the copy of the original into situations which would be out of reach for the original itself.” I would argue that it is absolutely original. To not only reproduce a work in a different context, but to introduce it to open doors that were once closed would be a first and hence, original.

2. **Permanence versus Convention**: I am not a fan of e-books; I never was nor did I think I ever would be. There are many reasons why I did not support the digitization of books. For one, the lack of page-turning makes the book seem endless. But most importantly, I thought it ruined tradition (codices). I found these readings particularly interesting because I learned about manifestations of the book prior to the codex. It made realize that at some point in time, the codex was also probably seen as a destroyer of tradition. Livingstone mentioned that the digitalization of stories has allowed us to keep records of books we might otherwise lose. This makes me think: Should we sacrifice tradition for permanence? Why must we continue to modernize the book; Is it always necessary? 

3. **What is a Book? Can Everything Be A Book?** This was the question that persisted as I read the readings and scrolled through Kit Davey’s Instagram. As a lover of stories, I would go as far as to say that anything can be a book as long as there’s a story to it. And I would also argue many artifacts, even your articles of clothing, contain stories. But where do we draw the line? If we could call anything a book, we essentially wouldn’t need anymore words in our vocabulary. So I guess my question is: **What’s *not* a book?**
