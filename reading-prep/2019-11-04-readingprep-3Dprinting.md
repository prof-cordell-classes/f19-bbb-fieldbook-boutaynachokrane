## Reading Prep: Week 10 Fabrication I: 3D PRINTING

#### Boutayna Chokrane 

### Questions and Observations
1. Garfinkel's article brings up interesting points about 3-D printing. *Can artifacts be separate from their linguistic meaning? Are they of significance if we can not articulate its value? Are linguistic interactions reflections or representations of material life?* Pierre-Louis brings up a similar question: *is 3-D printing really printing or are we just "borrowing" the terminology because we have no idea what else to call it?* 
2. 3-D printing is an example of where fields collide. Both science, art, and technology interlace to create what we call 3-D printing. I think all books take into consideration more than one field. *Are there properties of a book that are mutually exclusive to one medium?*
3. I'd like to discuss how 3-D printing is further used as public interactive forms. After our readings, I realized that I've encountered several exhibitions in Musuems that I didn't know used 3D printing. I wonder if 3D printing has rhetorical devices unique to its form.
