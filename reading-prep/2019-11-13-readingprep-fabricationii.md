### Questions & Observations 
1. Digital culture is percieved to be "threatening" to our traditional institutions. This is interesting because I always percieved the relationship between technology and society as bi-directional. In that case, are we not our own threats to culture – and are they threats or changes? Is it possible to regard materiality and culture as overlapping concepts rather than separate entities? 

2. Critical making is a powerful advocacy tool. During production, instrumental and aesthetic concerns are issues that shouldn't be handled separately. I think that both aspects can work together to create meanings for the audience. Aesthetic is a matter of what's relevant today. Can't aesthetics be used as a manipulative tool to draw people into the instrumental aspects of your work?

3. One of our readings subtly called for a "productive intervention in society." I would love to hear what my classmates thought about this. What does it mean? What would the "productive intervention" entail? Is it even justified? How can critical making and digital culture facilitate this intervention? How would books be useful as rhetorical tools? How are books productive? What makes us think people will respond well if they're already threatened by materiality.
