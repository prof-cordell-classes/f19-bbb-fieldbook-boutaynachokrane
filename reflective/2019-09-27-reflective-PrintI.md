##Reflective Entry: PRINT I 
####Boutayna Chokrane 
The renaissance of old-fashioned printing might not just be a byproduct of digital fatigue. I wouldn’t disagree – my personal distaste for e-books would support that idea.  When I get a phone notification that says I’ve spent thirty minutes looking at Instagram, I immediately grab the closest book I can find. I don’t know if it’s because I’m tired of looking at a screen or because the notification instilled shame, to some degree, in me. 

We’ve talked about how we assign virtue to strenuous tasks. With that reasoning, letterpress printing is more respectable than keyboard typography. Technology has made production and printing significantly easier:

	“No longer must an apprentice spend years learning to set metal letters 
	into rows; a computer design can be turned into a plastic printing plate."
	(“Well Pressed”, 2014)

Despite technology’s efficiency, critiques focus on how “easy” technology has made tasks. Easy is practically synonymous for lazy within this context. In today’s digital climate, many are criticized for being too reliant on technology. Engagement in old-fashioned printing might send a message of strength as opposed to digital submission – societally categorized as a weakness. 

Or could it be that we’re ashamed to turn our back on history and tradition? The rebirth of letterpress could be a result of our endearing efforts to stay connected to our roots and the fundamentals of typography. 
	
	“It is a safe bet that at least one Christmas card you receive this 
	year will be printed in the old-fashioned manner.”

Letterpress printing is tradition and can be meaningful to everyone. Maybe when you think of letterpress, you think of your family’s old christmas cards. It can be an emotional experience.
