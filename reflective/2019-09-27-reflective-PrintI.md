## Reflective Entry: PRINT I 

#### Boutayna Chokrane 

The renaissance of old-fashioned printing might not just be a byproduct of digital fatigue. I wouldn’t necessarily disagree – my personal distaste for e-books would support the prior argument.  And when I get a phone notification that says I’ve spent thirty minutes looking at Instagram, I immediately grab the closest book I can find. But I don’t know if it’s because I’m tired of looking at a screen or because the notification instilled shame, to some degree, in me. 

We’ve talked about how we assign virtue to strenuous tasks. With that reasoning, letterpress printing is more respectable than keyboard typography. Technology has made production and printing significantly easier:

	“No longer must an apprentice spend years learning to set metal letters into rows; a computer design can be turned into a plastic printing plate" (“Well Pressed”, 2014)."

Despite technology’s efficiency, critiques focus on how “easy” technology has made tasks. And easy is practically synonymous for lazy within this context. In today’s digital climate, many are criticized for being too reliant on technology. In an online article, "Is Technology Making us Lazy?", Nelson raises the question: 

	"Has the digital age made our minds weaker and deep thinking impossible?" (Nelson, 2016)

Old-fashioned printing sends a message of strength as opposed to digital submission; dependency on technology has been societally categorized as a weakness. That is a personal attack on our character. No one wants to be seen as lazy or *weak*.  

Or could it be that we’re ashamed to turn our back on history and tradition? The rebirth of letterpress could be a result of our endearing efforts to stay connected to our roots and the fundamentals of typography. 
	
	“It is a safe bet that at least one Christmas card you receive this year will be printed in the old-fashioned manner” (Lynch,2016). 

Letterpress printing is tradition and can be meaningful to everyone. Maybe when you think of letterpress, you think of the holidays. Tied to personal representations, letterpress can be an emotional experience – and one that even brings you closer to others. 

We don't recognize the rhetorical power behind the spaces between words. I would categorize the spaces between words as one of those creations that we've naturalized so much that we don't even pay attention to them. But the spaces between words created space between people. Lynch argues that nowadays, people associate reading with solitude. Letterpress printing forces you to acknowledge the spaces; ignorance in this case, could hurt the printing process of the text.

It also takes more than just one individual to manufacture a book using old-fashioned printing. With the new releases of technology most processes can be done individually, but that is not the case for the traditional way. Perhaps the renaissance of old-fashioned printing is because people are tired of silently rading yearn for interpersonal bonds. Letterpress might fill up those negative spaces. 

I would agree silent reading has become the norm but I'm not sure that the invention of spaces is to blame. I think that would be similar to saying digital technology is also to blame. Though it is possible that digital technology is directly responsible for the increase of separation, that would assume a uni-directional relationship between technology and society. 

	"In the Middle Ages, the Bible was only reproduced in its original Latin scriptura continua, meaning there were no spaces between the words. To differentiate between words, readers had to sound them out; no one read silently" (Lynch, 2016). 
	
This quote makes me think of when people talk about the "good old days" when we would say hello to everybody on the street and bring our neighbors casseroles for no apparent reason. We have this fear that technology is pulling us apart, but that implies that we take no responsibility for the effects of technology. Besides the fact that technology is man-made, people have the autonomy to choose how they use technology. Isn't it your fault if you spent ten hours staring at Netflix? 

For all we know, reading aloud was a burden. I can't imagine having to read without any spaces. We can romanticize about letterpress as much as we want, but we can't deny that technology had made printing more efficient and pragmatic. There is still rhetorical power in letterpress, so it is still very much relevant and valuable, and we can still recognize that without turning our backs on technology.
