## Reflective Entry: Binding 
#### Boutayna Chokrane 

The question on my mind during this week was: **how do we create more space for non-book lovers to enjoy books?**

I initally percieved letterpress printing to generally be an activity for the grandest 'bookworms'. This presumption partially derives from my personal experiences. When we were first introduced to letterpress printing, I couldn't help but geek out on all the types of fonts, the ink, and the different ways you could experiment with the printer. I also couldn't help but admire the antiquity of the letterpress; but I love books and I am deeply fascinated by history. I have friends, however, who I would assume wouldn't be interested in the letterpress. These friends are either not a fan of reading or their interests lie in other fields. After this week, I can confidently say my presumptions are wrong. 

What makes letterpress printing so phenomenal is that it's inclusive. It opens doors for non-readers and non-writers to engage in the realm of books. There are many features of the letterpress and some might appeal more to others. As a fellow 'bookworm', what I love the most about the letterpress is the variety and texture of the fonts. An engineer student might love to work on the letterpress because they love working with their hands. 

This reminded me of Alice's Book Presentation and the first definition she shared with us. The definition outlined what a book meant to different groups of people (i.e. what it meant for a writer was different than what it meant for the reader). Alice pointed out significant limitations of that definition that should be noted, but I do think there is some value to that definition. A book means different things for different people, just as a letterpress might mean something different for different people. 

Lindsay Schmittle said the main goal of her project was to "increase others' understanding and appreciation of nature's power to create seemingly magical moments." I think it's important to set objectives when creating books, but it's also important to realize that your goal will not be translated to everyone. It's impossible to ensure that everyone understands your work just as it's equally impossible to tailor your work to a certain audience. You can not control who sees your book, reads your book, or likes your book. But you can try your best to open as many doors for as many people to engage with your work.
