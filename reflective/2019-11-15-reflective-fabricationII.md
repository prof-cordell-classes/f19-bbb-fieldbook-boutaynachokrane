## Reflective Entry: Fabrication II 
#### Boutayna Chokrane 

Digital culture is a phenomenon that society is scared of. For years now we've been complaining about how technology is taking over our social world. We don't talk to our neighbors anymore. Kids would rather play on their iPads than in parks. We're obessessed wih virtual likes and don't care about personal interactions. These are common worries and we blame technology. 

However, this class taught me that the digital culture has done more good than harm. We might not talk to our neighbors anymore, but we're now able to access a wide range of communities from around the world in a manner of seconds. We've built social networks and personal connections with people through technology. And for the business of books this is advantageous. What better way to promote your creation than through the internet.  Before technology we couldn't choose who read our books. Technology has provided creators with more autonomy – they can choose their audience and consquently make their work more purposeful. 

Publication is also an issue that's been somewhat mitigated with the emergence of technology. Blogs, social media, applications like Twine are all accessible and affordable ways to self-publish your own work. Digital culture has also simultaneously allowed for the permanency and adaptivity of books. The physical manufacturing of books has limited writers to a one-time shot at communication. With technology, writers can always revise their works and adapt to changing circumstances. 

In our critical humanities reading the author writes, "the digital is threatening, but necessary." 

This is something I still wonder about. **Is the digital necessary?** We've been adapting and refining the book since it was invented. **At what point in time did digital culture become necessary? And necessary for what?** I've always viewed technology and digital culture as a luxury – something that we don't need, but have created for efficiency and coalition-building. **But is this all necessary? Could we continue to live in a world where codices were the most novel creation? Why not?**
