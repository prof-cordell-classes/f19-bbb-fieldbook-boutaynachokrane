## Reflective Entry: Zines
### Boutayna Chokrane 


Kennedy's narrative makes me think: **why do creators publish books?** We focused on a lot what could be considered a book and consequently, touched on the different purposes for books; but is that the same thing as why people choose to publish in the first place? 

	"I began publishing in an effort to procrastinate, to trick people into liking me, to get dates, to turn myself into a star, and to transform my boring life into an epic story." (Kennedy, 1995)
	
For Kennedy, publishing her work, at first, was not neccesarily about the content. It was much bigger than that because it was about *her*. Publishing meant that Kennedy could re-write her character in her story. There were external lures that Kennedy hoped she could acquire from publishing her work. This also makes me think about publication v. writing and whether there is a difference in purpose. 

Why people write books versus why people publish their books is different. For example, I think Kennedy wrote because it was vital to her well-being. Writing gave her guidance when she was a "directionless woman trying to muddle through her late twenties." (Kennedy, 1995) It was also a space where she could feel empowered because she was "the star" in her works. Writing is personal and doesn't always have to be showcased. Journaling is fairly common as a method It can be an opportunity to get to know yourself and develop your self-concept. I don't want to speak for her, but that was the presumption I concluded after reading "Zine." I definetely related to those sentiments and I think that's why I write. 

Why Kennedy decided to publish her work is different. If you decide to publish your book, you want your writing to be seen. You might want people to connect to your story, but that isn't *why* you wrote your book in the first place. 
I would argue that writing can sometimes be involuntary; some people need writing to survive. But publishing what you write is an active choice you voluntarily make. 

We sometimes see the cons of traditional publishing with big publishing companies. Once you submit your work, you lose some of that autonomy that you had when you were just writing. These companies reserve the right to edit and alter your story. Distribution and marketing strategies are also at the hands of the company. With traditional publishing, it's not guaranteed that your intended audience will have access to your book. People who creators might not even want to target might end up being their readers. Published works *do* allow creators to insert themselves and their stories into their communities, but it might not end up being their authentic selves. When Kennedy moved back to Boston she wrote a novel that she "thought [she] *should* write, one that had nothing to do with [her] at all." (Kennedy, 1995) 

*Zines* extract most of these cons, but maintain the collective sentiment. Zines allow creators to preserve the autonomy they started with. They get to choose what to write and who reads it. They get to choose what communities they'd like to be immersed in. During one of our class discussions, Molly told us that zines can be secretive; they could be shared with just your friends. Zines are intimate experiences that make readers feel like they are part of something. When Professor Cordell shared a prior student's zine, it was a special moment for me. This zine was only shared by some, not the whole world and I had the honor to read it. The content inside felt less like a traditional published work and more of a mosiac of the creator's thoughts. Even though I never met the writer, I felt like I knew her (or a part of her). Books connect readers to the story. Zines gives readers an authentic opportunity to connect to the *writers*. 

Published zines leave the creators' initial writing purpose untainted. I love zines because they defy the binary. Concepts that I thought would clash, happily co-exist. They can simultaneously be intimate and public. Zines are exclusive, but also inclusive. An individual and collaborative experience.
