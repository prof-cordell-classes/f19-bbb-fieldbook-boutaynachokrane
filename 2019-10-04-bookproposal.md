## Semester Book Project Proposal 
### Boutayna Chokrane 
I want to create an anthology about self-advocacy. I’m using this term broadly; I don’t mean a collection of poems, but rather a collection of work by people. This can include but is not limited to poetry, photos, short stories, quotes, art work, etc. Most of the content will be written by me, but I’m also incorporating other works by peers I have connected with through writing. 

This book will be a zine, but will also be printed and bound. I want to incorporate the features of a letterpress chapbook, especially when showcasing the poetry. I want to create a zine because of the nature of the content of the book, but also because of its accessibility. There are so many talented writers at Northeastern who are trying to get their work published, but it’s difficult. I want this to be an opportunity to showcase some of that work, but I also want people to see it! I was also inspired by Professor Cordell’s former student. A zine would get me out of my comfort zone and challenge me creatively. 

This is an individual project in terms of the manufacturing process. I will be reaching out to some of my peers and maybe other students from Northeastern for some additional work to include in my zine. The one skill I still need to learn to execute this project is how to bind letterpress chapbooks, but I believe that’s next on our schedule! 
Because it is a zine, I will try to acquire most of my materials from campus. I would like to borrow Professor Cordell’s zine copies for inspiration; I’ll also be taking a trip to the archives for references.  I’m part of TasteMakers Magazine and Huntington News, so it shouldn’t be too difficult collecting publications. I would need art supplies that I would borrow from the CAMD department and purchase from Blick. I will also need to set time aside to use the letterpress during working hours. I am unsure about what’s the best approach to print the photos for my book; I will reach out to the photography department and Professor Cordell for advice.  

Evidently, I’m doing this project for a grade – but my primary goal for this book is to freely explore manifestations of what a book can be. This class taught me that a book is boundless and I’m hoping that my project will reflect the limitlessness of “the book”. I’ll know that I’ve accomplished my goal if people can’t limit its format or content into one category. Ideally, I would also love to end up distributing the zine – or at least making it accessible to students. My last goal is more of a personal one. Pagan Kennedy said it best; I’m just “another, out-of-whack directionless woman trying to muddle through her [twenties].” I hope that people connect to my project; that would make all the difference.
