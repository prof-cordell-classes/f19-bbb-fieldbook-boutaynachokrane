##Reading Prep: What Is A Book?

###Questions and Observations 
1. Frederick Kilgour’s definition of “book” was an interesting one, but one I had many questions about. The prime component of his definition is that the book must be portable or at least transportable. The inclusion of the book’s portability raises a couple of questions: **(1) Why did Kilgour believe transportability was key? Did this have anything to do with the functional purposes of the book at that time? (2) Must a book be portable?** My preliminary thought for the second question is no. What about the black stone of Mecca? The Pyramids? The Great Wall of China? Not so portable...

2. *“In China, an entire mountain can be a book, a calligraphic catalogue of historical events. For example, in Quanzhou, there is a mountain whose cliffs are inscribed with maritime stories, such as historical accounts of Zheng He’s travels to the Western Ocean. In this way, even nature can be considered a medium for writing books.”* 
	 
	 I love this quote because it transcends all of our expectations of what a book is or could be. Many perceive nature to be separate from human existence, but I think their relationship is bidirectional. Nature is constantly being influenced by the codes of our culture, including but not limited to our language, sense perception, and values. We’re constantly interacting with the environment around us; it makes sense that we’ve engraved parts of our identities and stories into the Earth. 

3. In the last chapter of The Book, the author goes on to talk about the emergence of audio books. In the past, I’ve never enjoyed audio books because I lose track of what the narrator is reading. I either don’t like their voice, get bored, or prefer to go at my own pace. But I do like podcasts. This makes me question, **can podcasts be books?** There are certain elements of podcasts that audio books might benefit from. For example, often times in podcasts there are two people interacting. **What if audio books evolved so that narrators acted out the story instead? Are there certain features from podcasts than audio books can benefit from? What problems have risen with books after the birth of audio books? How can we make audio books less boring?**
